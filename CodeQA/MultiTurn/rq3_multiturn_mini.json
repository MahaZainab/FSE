      "student_mental_model": "The student appears to have a fundamental misunderstanding of what the code actually does. It seems to think that because the code has 'EINTR' in it, it must raise that error. The student focused on the presence of the string 'EINTR' in the code rather than analyzing the actual logic flow. It also misunderstood the relationship between the TA's prediction and the reference answer, thinking that the TA was correct when it was actually wrong. The student's attention was drawn to surface features (the word 'EINTR') rather than the deeper functional behavior of the code.",
      "theory_of_mind_guidance": "The student's reasoning shows a pattern of surface-level analysis where it focuses on keywords rather than functional behavior. It failed to trace through the control flow properly: the code catches EnvironmentError, checks if errno == EINTR, and then re-raises it. This means EINTR is NOT raised by the function itself, but rather re-raised when caught. The student needs to develop better code reading skills - specifically, understanding that 'raising' and 'catching' are different operations, and that the code structure determines behavior, not just keyword presence. The student should focus on the logical flow and conditional execution rather than isolated terms.",
      "improved_judgment_example": "Accuracy: 3 - The code does NOT raise an EINTR error. It catches EnvironmentError and re-raises it only if the error's errno equals EINTR, which means EINTR is handled, not raised. Completeness: 3 - The judgment covers the core issue: the function's behavior regarding EINTR handling. Relevance: 3 - Directly addresses whether the function raises EINTR, which is exactly what was asked. Clarity: 3 - Clear explanation that the code handles EINTR by catching and re-raising it, so it doesn't raise it itself."
